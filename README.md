# Go-Intro
Introduction to Go

This repository houses some code I played with when learning Go.

You can copy and paste the code into your machine,
to see for yourself what they yield.
To run sqrt.go, for example, you can run it with this command:
```
go run sqrt.go
```

(To do that, if you don't already have Go installed, you can go here: _____)

The code are primarily answers to some problems on the tour given by the Go authors at go.dev.
